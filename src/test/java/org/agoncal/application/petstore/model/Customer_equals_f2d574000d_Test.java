 You have a method called `equals` that takes an object as an argument. The method returns true if the object is the same as the current object, or if the object is a Customer and the login field of the two objects are equal. You want to write test scenarios to validate the business logic of this method. Here are some test scenarios that you can use:

**1. Test scenario 1:**

**Objective:** To test if the method returns true when the object is the same as the current object.

**Test steps:**

1. Create a Customer object.
2. Call the `equals` method of the Customer object, passing the same object as an argument.
3. Assert that the method returns true.

**Expected result:**

The method should return true.

**2. Test scenario 2:**

**Objective:** To test if the method returns true when the object is a Customer and the login field of the two objects are equal.

**Test steps:**

1. Create a Customer object.
2. Create another Customer object with the same login field as the first object.
3. Call the `equals` method of the first Customer object, passing the second object as an argument.
4. Assert that the method returns true.

**Expected result:**

The method should return true.

**3. Test scenario 3:**

**Objective:** To test if the method returns false when the object is not a Customer.

**Test steps:**

1. Create a non-Customer object.
2. Call the `equals` method of the Customer object, passing the non-Customer object as an argument.
3. Assert that the method returns false.

**Expected result:**

The method should return false.

**4. Test scenario 4:**

**Objective:** To test if the method returns false when the object is a Customer but the login field of the two objects are different.

**Test steps:**

1. Create a Customer object.
2. Create another Customer object with a different login field than the first object.
3. Call the `equals` method of the first Customer object, passing the second object as an argument.
4. Assert that the method returns false.

**Expected result:**

The method should return false.
