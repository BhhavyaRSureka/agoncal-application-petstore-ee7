 You need to write test scenarios for the given code snippet `hashCode` to validate the business logic. Here are some test scenarios that you can consider:

**Test Scenario 1: Verify the hashCode Method:**
- Objective: Verify that the `hashCode` method returns a consistent hash code for objects with the same `quantity` and `item` values.
- Test Steps:
  1. Create two objects with the same `quantity` and `item` values.
  2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  3. Assert that the hash codes returned by both objects are the same.

**Test Scenario 2: Verify Hash Code for Different Quantity Values:**
- Objective: Ensure that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for objects with different `quantity` values, even if the `item` values are the same.
- Test Steps:
  1. Create two objects with different `quantity` values but the same `item` value.
  2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  3. Assert that the hash codes returned by both objects are different.

**Test Scenario 3: Verify Hash Code for Different Item Values:**
- Objective: Confirm that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for objects with different `item` values, even if the `quantity` values are the same.
- Test Steps:
  1. Create two objects with the same `quantity` value but different `item` values.
  2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  3. Assert that the hash codes returned by both objects are different.

**Test Scenario 4: Verify Hash Code for Null Quantity and Item Values:**
- Objective: Check that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for objects with null `quantity` and `item` values.
- Test Steps:
  1. Create two objects with null `quantity` and `item` values.
  2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  3. Assert that the hash codes returned by both objects are different.

**Test Scenario 5: Verify Hash Code for Objects with Different Class Types:**
- Objective: Ensure that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for objects of different class types, even if the `quantity` and `item` values are the same.
- Test Steps:
  1. Create two objects with the same `quantity` and `item` values but different class types.
  2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
  3. Assert that the hash codes returned by both objects are different.
