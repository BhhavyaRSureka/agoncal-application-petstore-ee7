 You have been given a code snippet function hashCode to validate business logic. You need to write test scenarios for this code snippet to validate business logic.

**Test Scenario 1:**

**Objective:** To verify that the hashCode() method correctly computes the hash code for an object based on its name and description fields.

**Test Case:**

1. Create a Person object with a non-null name and description.
2. Call the hashCode() method on the Person object.
3. Verify that the returned hash code is a valid integer value.
4. Modify the name or description field of the Person object.
5. Call the hashCode() method on the Person object again.
6. Verify that the returned hash code is different from the hash code obtained in step 3.

**Expected Result:**

The hashCode() method should return a valid integer value that is unique for each combination of name and description fields. Modifying either the name or description field should result in a different hash code.

**Test Scenario 2:**

**Objective:** To verify that the hashCode() method returns the same hash code for two objects with the same name and description fields, even if the objects are created at different times or in different contexts.

**Test Case:**

1. Create two Person objects with the same name and description.
2. Call the hashCode() method on both Person objects.
3. Verify that the returned hash codes are equal.

**Expected Result:**

The hashCode() method should return the same hash code for two objects with the same name and description fields, regardless of when or where the objects were created.

**Test Scenario 3:**

**Objective:** To verify that the hashCode() method returns different hash codes for objects with different name or description fields, even if the other fields are the same.

**Test Case:**

1. Create two Person objects with different name or description fields.
2. Call the hashCode() method on both Person objects.
3. Verify that the returned hash codes are different.

**Expected Result:**

The hashCode() method should return different hash codes for objects with different name or description fields, even if the other fields are the same.

**Test Scenario 4:**

**Objective:** To verify that the hashCode() method returns a consistent hash code for an object, even if the object is modified after it has been created.

**Test Case:**

1. Create a Person object with a non-null name and description.
2. Call the hashCode() method on the Person object.
3. Modify the name or description field of the Person object.
4. Call the hashCode() method on the Person object again.
5. Verify that the returned hash code is the same as the hash code obtained in step 2.

**Expected Result:**

The hashCode() method should return the same hash code for an object, even if the object is modified after it has been created.
