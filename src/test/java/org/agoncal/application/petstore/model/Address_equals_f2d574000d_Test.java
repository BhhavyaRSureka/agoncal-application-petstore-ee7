 Given the following code snippet:

```
import javax.persistence.CascadeType;
import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Embeddable;
import javax.persistence.ManyToOne;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;
import javax.validation.constraints.Size;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Objects;
public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Address address = (Address) o;
        return street1.equals(address.street1) && city.equals(address.city) && zipcode.equals(address.zipcode);
    }
```

Please write test scenarios to validate business logic for the equals method.

**Test Scenario 1:**

**Test Objective:** To test if the equals method correctly compares two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create two Address objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode.
2. Call the equals method on one object with the other object as the argument.
3. Assert that the result of the equals method is true.

**Expected Result:**

The equals method should return true since the two Address objects have the same street1, city, and zipcode.

**Test Scenario 2:**

**Test Objective:** To test if the equals method correctly compares two Address objects with different street1 values.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create two Address objects with different street1 values.
2. Call the equals method on one object with the other object as the argument.
3. Assert that the result of the equals method is false.

**Expected Result:**

The equals method should return false since the two Address objects have different street1 values.

**Test Scenario 3:**

**Test Objective:** To test if the equals method correctly compares two Address objects with different city values.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create two Address objects with different city values.
2. Call the equals method on one object with the other object as the argument.
3. Assert that the result of the equals method is false.

**Expected Result:**

The equals method should return false since the two Address objects have different city values.

**Test Scenario 4:**

**Test Objective:** To test if the equals method correctly compares two Address objects with different zipcode values.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create two Address objects with different zipcode values.
2. Call the equals method on one object with the other object as the argument.
3. Assert that the result of the equals method is false.

**Expected Result:**

The equals method should return false since the two Address objects have different zipcode values.

**Test Scenario 5:**

**Test Objective:** To test if the equals method correctly compares an Address object with a null object.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create an Address object.
2. Call the equals method on the Address object with a null object as the argument.
3. Assert that the result of the equals method is false.

**Expected Result:**

The equals method should return false since one of the objects is null.

**Test Scenario 6:**

**Test Objective:** To test if the equals method correctly compares an Address object with an object of a different class.

**Test Steps:**

1. Create an Address object.
2. Create an object of a different class.
3. Call the equals method on the Address object with the object of a different class as the argument.
4. Assert that the result of the equals method is false.

**Expected Result:**

The equals method should return false since the two objects are of different classes.
