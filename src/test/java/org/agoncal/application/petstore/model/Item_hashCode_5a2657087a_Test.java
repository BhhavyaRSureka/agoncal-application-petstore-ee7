 You need to write test scenarios for the code snippet `hashCode` to validate business logic.

**Test Scenario 1:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns the same hash code for two objects with the same `name` and `description` properties.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create two `Product` objects with the same `name` and `description` properties.
    2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
    3. Assert that the two hash codes are equal.

**Test Scenario 2:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for two objects with different `name` properties.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create two `Product` objects with different `name` properties.
    2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
    3. Assert that the two hash codes are different.

**Test Scenario 3:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for two objects with different `description` properties.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create two `Product` objects with different `description` properties.
    2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
    3. Assert that the two hash codes are different.

**Test Scenario 4:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns the same hash code for two objects with the same `name` and `description` properties, even if the objects are created at different times.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create two `Product` objects with the same `name` and `description` properties, but create them at different times.
    2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
    3. Assert that the two hash codes are equal.

**Test Scenario 5:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different hash codes for two objects with the same `name` and `description` properties, if the objects are created in different threads.
* **Steps:**
    1. Create two `Product` objects with the same `name` and `description` properties, but create them in different threads.
    2. Call the `hashCode` method on both objects.
    3. Assert that the two hash codes are different.
