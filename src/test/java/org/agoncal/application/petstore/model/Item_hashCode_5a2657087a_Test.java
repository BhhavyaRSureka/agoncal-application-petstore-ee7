 But, you have to remember that the hashCode method is used to generate a hash code for an object. It is used by hash-based data structures, such as HashMap, HashSet, and Hashtable, to determine which bucket an object belongs to.

The hashCode method is defined in the Object class, and it returns a 32-bit integer. The default implementation of the hashCode method returns the memory address of the object.

The Objects.hash method is a static method that returns a hash code for a set of objects. It takes a variable number of arguments, and it returns a hash code that is based on the hash codes of the individual objects.

The following are some test scenarios that you can use to validate the business logic of the hashCode method:

1. **Scenario 1:**
   - Given two objects with the same name and description
   - When the hashCode method is called on both objects
   - Then the two objects should have the same hash code

2. **Scenario 2:**
   - Given two objects with different names and descriptions
   - When the hashCode method is called on both objects
   - Then the two objects should have different hash codes

3. **Scenario 3:**
   - Given an object with a null name and description
   - When the hashCode method is called on the object
   - Then the object should have a hash code of 0

4. **Scenario 4:**
   - Given an object with a non-null name and a null description
   - When the hashCode method is called on the object
   - Then the object should have a hash code that is based on the hash code of the name

5. **Scenario 5:**
   - Given an object with a null name and a non-null description
   - When the hashCode method is called on the object
   - Then the object should have a hash code that is based on the hash code of the description
