 You are given the code snippet of the `hashCode` method. You need to write test scenarios to validate the business logic of this method.

**Test Scenario 1:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns the same value for two objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
* **Input:**
    * Two `Address` objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values.
* **Expected Output:**
    * Both objects should return the same `hashCode` value.

**Test Scenario 2:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different values for two objects with different street1, city, or zipcode values.
* **Input:**
    * Two `Address` objects with different street1, city, or zipcode values.
* **Expected Output:**
    * Both objects should return different `hashCode` values.

**Test Scenario 3:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns the same value for two objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values, even if the objects are created at different times.
* **Input:**
    * Two `Address` objects with the same street1, city, and zipcode values, created at different times.
* **Expected Output:**
    * Both objects should return the same `hashCode` value.

**Test Scenario 4:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different values for two objects with the same street1 and city values, but different zipcode values.
* **Input:**
    * Two `Address` objects with the same street1 and city values, but different zipcode values.
* **Expected Output:**
    * Both objects should return different `hashCode` values.

**Test Scenario 5:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different values for two objects with the same street1 and zipcode values, but different city values.
* **Input:**
    * Two `Address` objects with the same street1 and zipcode values, but different city values.
* **Expected Output:**
    * Both objects should return different `hashCode` values.

**Test Scenario 6:**
* **Objective:** Verify that the `hashCode` method returns different values for two objects with the same city and zipcode values, but different street1 values.
* **Input:**
    * Two `Address` objects with the same city and zipcode values, but different street1 values.
* **Expected Output:**
    * Both objects should return different `hashCode` values.
