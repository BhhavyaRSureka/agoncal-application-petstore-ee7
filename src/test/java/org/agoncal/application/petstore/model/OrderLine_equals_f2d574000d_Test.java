 You are asked to write test scenarios for the following code snippet. The function `equals` is used to compare two objects of the same class.

```
import javax.persistence.*;
import javax.validation.constraints.Min;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.Objects;
public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        OrderLine orderLine = (OrderLine) o;
        return quantity.equals(orderLine.quantity) && item.equals(orderLine.item);
    }
```

Here are some test scenarios that you can use to validate the business logic of the `equals` method:

**1. Reflexivity:**

* **Scenario:** Given an object, it should be equal to itself.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
boolean result = orderLine1.equals(orderLine1);
assertEquals(true, result);
```

**2. Symmetry:**

* **Scenario:** If two objects are equal, then they should be equal in both directions.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine();
orderLine1.setQuantity(10);
orderLine1.setItem("Item 1");
orderLine2.setQuantity(10);
orderLine2.setItem("Item 1");

boolean result1 = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);
boolean result2 = orderLine2.equals(orderLine1);
assertEquals(true, result1);
assertEquals(true, result2);
```

**3. Transitivity:**

* **Scenario:** If two objects are equal to a third object, then they should be equal to each other.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine3 = new OrderLine();
orderLine1.setQuantity(10);
orderLine1.setItem("Item 1");
orderLine2.setQuantity(10);
orderLine2.setItem("Item 1");
orderLine3.setQuantity(10);
orderLine3.setItem("Item 1");

boolean result1 = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);
boolean result2 = orderLine2.equals(orderLine3);
boolean result3 = orderLine1.equals(orderLine3);

assertEquals(true, result1);
assertEquals(true, result2);
assertEquals(true, result3);
```

**4. Consistency:**

* **Scenario:** Multiple calls to the `equals` method with the same objects should always return the same result.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine();
orderLine1.setQuantity(10);
orderLine1.setItem("Item 1");
orderLine2.setQuantity(10);
orderLine2.setItem("Item 1");

boolean result1 = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);
boolean result2 = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);
boolean result3 = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);

assertEquals(true, result1);
assertEquals(true, result2);
assertEquals(true, result3);
```

**5. Null Check:**

* **Scenario:** Passing a null object to the `equals` method should return false.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine2 = null;

boolean result = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);

assertEquals(false, result);
```

**6. Different Class:**

* **Scenario:** Comparing an object with an object of a different class should return false.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
String str = "Item 1";

boolean result = orderLine1.equals(str);

assertEquals(false, result);
```

**7. Different Quantity:**

* **Scenario:** Comparing two objects with different quantities should return false.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine();
orderLine1.setQuantity(10);
orderLine1.setItem("Item 1");
orderLine2.setQuantity(20);
orderLine2.setItem("Item 1");

boolean result = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);

assertEquals(false, result);
```

**8. Different Item:**

* **Scenario:** Comparing two objects with different items should return false.
* **Test:**
```java
OrderLine orderLine1 = new OrderLine();
OrderLine orderLine2 = new OrderLine();
orderLine1.setQuantity(10);
orderLine1.setItem("Item 1");
orderLine2.setQuantity(10);
orderLine2.setItem("Item 2");

boolean result = orderLine1.equals(orderLine2);

assertEquals(false, result);
```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `equals` method and help ensure that it works correctly according to the defined business logic.
