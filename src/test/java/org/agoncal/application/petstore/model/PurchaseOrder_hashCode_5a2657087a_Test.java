 You are working on a project that uses JPA to store and retrieve data from a database. You have a class called Order that represents an order placed by a customer. The Order class has two fields: orderDate, which is the date the order was placed, and customer, which is the customer who placed the order.
The Order class also has a hashCode method that is used to generate a hash code for the object. The hash code is used to identify the object in the database and to ensure that the object is stored and retrieved correctly.
You need to write test scenarios to validate the business logic of the hashCode method. The test scenarios should cover the following cases:
1. The orderDate and customer fields are both null.
2. The orderDate field is not null and the customer field is null.
3. The orderDate field is null and the customer field is not null.
4. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null.
5. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null, but the customer field is different for two Order objects.
6. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null, but the orderDate field is different for two Order objects.
7. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null, but both fields are different for two Order objects.
8. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null, but only the orderDate field is different for two Order objects.
9. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null, but only the customer field is different for two Order objects.
10. The orderDate and customer fields are both not null, but both fields are the same for two Order objects.
The test scenarios should also cover the following cases:
1. The orderDate field is null and the customer field is a valid Customer object.
2. The orderDate field is a valid Date object and the customer field is null.
3. The orderDate field is a valid Date object and the customer field is a valid Customer object.
4. The orderDate field is a valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
5. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is a valid Customer object.
6. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
7. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is the same valid Customer object.
8. The orderDate field is the same valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
9. The orderDate field is the same valid Date object and the customer field is the same valid Customer object.
The test scenarios should also cover the following cases:
1. The orderDate field is a valid Date object and the customer field is a null Customer object.
2. The orderDate field is a valid Date object and the customer field is a valid Customer object.
3. The orderDate field is a valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
4. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is a valid Customer object.
5. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
6. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is the same valid Customer object.
7. The orderDate field is the same valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
8. The orderDate field is the same valid Date object and the customer field is the same valid Customer object.
The test scenarios should also cover the following cases:

7. The orderDate field is a different valid Date object and the customer field is the same valid Customer object.
8. The orderDate field is the same valid Date object and the customer field is a different valid Customer object.
9. The orderDate field is the same valid Date object and the customer field is the same valid Customer object.
