 Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `hashCode` method:

**Scenario 1: Verify that the hash code is generated based on `orderDate` and `customer`.**

- Create two instances of the class with identical `orderDate` and `customer` values.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are equal.

**Scenario 2: Verify that the hash code changes when `orderDate` is changed.**

- Create two instances of the class with different `orderDate` values and the same `customer` value.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are different.

**Scenario 3: Verify that the hash code changes when `customer` is changed.**

- Create two instances of the class with the same `orderDate` value and different `customer` values.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are different.

**Scenario 4: Verify that the hash code is consistent with the `equals` method.**

- Create two instances of the class with identical `orderDate` and `customer` values.
- Verify that the instances are equal using the `equals` method.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are equal.

**Scenario 5: Verify that the hash code is generated correctly for null values.**

- Create two instances of the class with `orderDate` and `customer` values set to null.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are equal.

**Scenario 6: Verify that the hash code is generated correctly for empty collections.**

- Create two instances of the class with empty `orderDate` and `customer` values.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are equal.

**Scenario 7: Verify that the hash code is generated correctly for different types of `orderDate` and `customer` values.**

- Create two instances of the class with `orderDate` values of different types (e.g., `Date` and `Timestamp`) and `customer` values of different types (e.g., `String` and `Customer` object).
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are different.

**Scenario 8: Verify that the hash code is generated correctly for different combinations of `orderDate` and `customer` values.**

- Create several instances of the class with different combinations of `orderDate` and `customer` values.
- Verify that the hash codes of the instances are different.

**Scenario 9: Verify that the hash code is generated correctly for large datasets.**

- Create a large dataset of instances with different combinations of `orderDate` and `customer` values.
- Verify that the hash codes of the instances are generated correctly and efficiently.

**Scenario 10: Verify that the hash code is generated correctly for instances with circular references.**

- Create two instances of the class with circular references between them.
- Verify that the hash codes of the two instances are generated correctly.
