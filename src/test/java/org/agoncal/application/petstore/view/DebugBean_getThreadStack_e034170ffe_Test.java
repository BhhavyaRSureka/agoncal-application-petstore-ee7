 Here are some test scenarios for the getThreadStack function:

1. **Test Scenario 1:**
   - Objective: To verify that the function correctly captures the stack trace of the current thread.
   - Test Steps:
     - Call the getThreadStack function and store the returned list of strings in a variable.
     - Assert that the size of the list is greater than 0.
     - Assert that the first element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the caller of the getThreadStack function.
     - Assert that the last element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the main method.

2. **Test Scenario 2:**
   - Objective: To verify that the function correctly captures the stack trace of a specific thread.
   - Test Steps:
     - Create a new thread and start it.
     - Call the getThreadStack function on the newly created thread and store the returned list of strings in a variable.
     - Assert that the size of the list is greater than 0.
     - Assert that the first element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the main method of the newly created thread.
     - Assert that the last element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the method that created the thread.

3. **Test Scenario 3:**
   - Objective: To verify that the function correctly captures the stack trace of a thread that is blocked on a synchronized block.
   - Test Steps:
     - Create a synchronized block and acquire the lock.
     - Call the getThreadStack function on the current thread and store the returned list of strings in a variable.
     - Assert that the size of the list is greater than 0.
     - Assert that the first element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the synchronized block.
     - Assert that the last element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the method that called the synchronized block.

4. **Test Scenario 4:**
   - Objective: To verify that the function correctly captures the stack trace of a thread that is waiting on a condition.
   - Test Steps:
     - Create a condition variable and wait on it.
     - Call the getThreadStack function on the current thread and store the returned list of strings in a variable.
     - Assert that the size of the list is greater than 0.
     - Assert that the first element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the condition variable.
     - Assert that the last element of the list contains the class name, method name, file name, and line number of the method that called the condition variable.
